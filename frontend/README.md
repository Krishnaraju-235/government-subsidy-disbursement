Govt Subsidy Disbursement Tracking System

A full-stack web application for managing and tracking the disbursement of government subsidies — from beneficiary application to officer verification, admin approval, and final fund disbursement — built with a Spring Boot backend and a React frontend.
---
Overview
Government subsidy programs typically involve multiple parties (beneficiaries, verifying officers, and administrators) and multiple stages (application, verification, approval, disbursement). This system digitizes that entire lifecycle, replacing manual paperwork with a transparent, role-based tracking platform where every application's status is visible in real time.
---
Key Features
Role-based access control for Admin, Officer, and Beneficiary users using Spring Security and JWT authentication
Subsidy application workflow: beneficiaries submit applications, officers verify documents/eligibility, admins approve or reject
Real-time status tracking so beneficiaries can see whether an application is pending, under verification, approved, rejected, or disbursed
Disbursement management for admins to record and track fund transfers against approved applications
Dashboards tailored to each role — beneficiaries see their applications, officers see assigned verifications, admins see program-wide analytics
Audit trail of status changes for accountability and transparency
RESTful API connecting the React frontend to the Spring Boot backend

Modules
The system is organized into the following functional modules:
Module	Description
Auth Module	Handles registration, login, JWT token generation/validation, and role-based access control
Beneficiary Module	Beneficiary profile management, subsidy application submission, and document uploads
Officer Module	Assigned-application review, eligibility/document verification, and decision forwarding
Admin Module	Scheme management, officer management, application approval/rejection, and disbursement triggering
Application Module	Core subsidy application entity — creation, status transitions, and history tracking
Disbursement Module	Records and tracks fund transfers against approved applications
Notification Module	Status-change alerts to beneficiaries (planned — see Roadmap)
Reporting/Analytics Module	Program-wide statistics and dashboards for admins

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java 17+
Node.js 18+
MySQL 8+
Maven
Backend Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akshay1code/govt-subsidy-disbursement-tracking-system.git
cd govt-subsidy-disbursement-tracking-system/backend

# Configure your MySQL credentials in src/main/resources/application.properties

mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Frontend Setup
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
```
The backend API will run on `http://localhost:8080` and the frontend on `http://localhost:3000` by default.
